"""Zfit serialization module.

This module contains the serialization functionality of zfit. It is used to serialize and deserialize
zfit objects to a string representation.
The output format adheres to the HS3 standard (NOT YET, but will be in the future).

The serialization is done via the :py:class:`~zfit.serializer.Serializer` class.
