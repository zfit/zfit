        """NLopt is a library that contains multiple different optimization algorithms.

         |@doc:minimizer.nlopt.info| More information on the algorithm can be found
        `here <https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Algorithms/>`_.

        This implenemtation uses internally the
        `NLopt library <https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
        It is a
        free/open-source library for nonlinear optimization,
        providing a common interface for a number of
        different free optimization routines available online as well as
        original implementations of various other algorithms. |@docend:minimizer.nlopt.info|

         Args:

             algorithm: Define which algorithm to be used. These are taken from `nlopt.ALGORITHM` (where `ALGORITHM` is
                 the actual algorithm). A comprehensive list and description of all implemented algorithms is
                 available `here <https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Algorithms/>`_.
                 The wrapper is optimized for Local gradient-based optimization and may break with
                 others. However, please post a feature request in case other algorithms are requested.

                 The naming of the algorithm starts with either L/G (Local/Global)
                  and N/D (derivative-free/derivative-based).

                 Local optimizer options include (but are not limited to)

                 Derivative free:
                 - LN_NELDERMEAD: The Nelder Mead Simplex algorithm, which seems to perform not so well, but can be used
                   to narrow down a minimum.
                 - LN_SBPLX: SubPlex is an improved version of the Simplex algorithms and usually performs better.

                 With derivative:
                 - LD_MMA: Method of Moving Asymptotes, an improved CCSA
                   ("conservative convex separable approximation") variant of the original MMA algorithm
                 - LD_SLSQP: this is a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm for (nonlinearly constrained)
                   gradient-based optimization
                 - LD_LBFGS: version of the famous low-storage BFGS algorithm, an approximate Newton method. The same as
                   the Minuit algorithm is built on.
                 - LD_TNEWTON_PRECOND_RESTART, LD_TNEWTON_PRECOND, LD_TNEWTON_RESTART, LD_TNEWTON: a preconditioned
                   inexact truncated Newton algorithm. Multiple variations, with and without preconditioning and/or
                   restart are provided.
                 - LD_VAR1, LD_VAR2: a shifted limited-memory variable-metric algorithm, either using a rank 1 or rank 2
                   method.

             tol: |@doc:minimizer.tol| Termination value for the
                   convergence/stopping criterion of the algorithm
                   in order to determine if the minimum has
                   been found. Defaults to 1e-3. |@docend:minimizer.tol|
             gradient: Gradient that will be given to the minimizer if supported.
             hessian: Hessian that will be given to the minimizer if supported.
             internal_tols: Tolerances for the minimizer. Has to contain possible tolerance criteria.
             verbosity: |@doc:minimizer.verbosity| Verbosity of the minimizer. Has to be between 0 and 10.
              The verbosity has the meaning:

               - a value of 0 means quiet and no output
               - above 0 up to 5, information that is good to know but without
                 flooding the user, corresponding to a "INFO" level.
               - A value above 5 starts printing out considerably more and
                 is used more for debugging purposes.
               - Setting the verbosity to 10 will print out every
                 evaluation of the loss function and gradient.

               Some minimizers offer additional output which is also
               distributed as above but may duplicate certain printed values. |@docend:minimizer.verbosity|
             criterion: |@doc:minimizer.criterion| Criterion of the minimum. This is an
                   estimated measure for the distance to the
                   minimum and can include the relative
                   or absolute changes of the parameters,
                   function value, gradients and more.
                   If the value of the criterion is smaller
                   than ``loss.errordef * tol``, the algorithm
                   stopps and it is assumed that the minimum
                   has been found. |@docend:minimizer.criterion|
             strategy: |@doc:minimizer.strategy| A class of type ``ZfitStrategy`` that takes no
                   input arguments in the init. Determines the behavior of the minimizer in
                   certain situations, most notably when encountering
                   NaNs. It can also implement a callback function. |@docend:minimizer.strategy|
             maxiter: |@doc:minimizer.maxiter| Approximate number of iterations.
                   This corresponds to roughly the maximum number of
                   evaluations of the ``value``, 'gradient`` or ``hessian``. |@docend:minimizer.maxiter|
             minimizer_options: Additional options that will be set in the minimizer.
             name: |@doc:minimizer.name| Human-readable name of the minimizer. |@docend:minimizer.name|

        This is a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm for
        non-linearly gradient-based optimization based on the implementation by
        Dieter Kraft and described in:

        -  Dieter Kraft, “A software package for sequential quadratic
           programming”, Technical Report DFVLR-FB 88-28, Institut für Dynamik
           der Flugsysteme, Oberpfaffenhofen, July 1988.
        -  Dieter Kraft, “Algorithm 733: TOMP-Fortran modules for optimal
           control calculations,” *ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software*,
           vol. 20, no. 3, pp. 262-281 (1994).

        The algorithm optimizes
        successive second-order (quadratic/least-squares) approximations of the
        objective function (via BFGS updates), with first-order (affine)
        approximations of the constraints.

        The Fortran code was obtained from the SciPy project, who are
        responsible for `obtaining permission`_ to distribute it under a
        free-software (3-clause BSD) license.

        The code was modified for inclusion in NLopt by S. G. Johnson in 2010,
        with the following changes. The code was converted to C and manually
        cleaned up. It was modified to be re-entrant (preserving the
        reverse-communication interface but explicitly saving the state in a
        data structure). The inexact line
        search was modified to evaluate the functions including gradients for
        the first step, since this removes the need to evaluate the
        function+gradient a second time for the same point in the common case
        when the inexact line search concludes after a single step.

        **Note:** Because the SLSQP code uses dense-matrix methods (ordinary
        BFGS, not low-storage BFGS), it requires *O*\ (*n*\ 2) storage and
        *O*\ (*n*\ 3) time in *n* dimensions, which makes it less practical for
        optimizing more than a few thousand parameters.

           methods based on conservative convex separable approximations`_,”
           *SIAM J. Optim.* **12** (2), p. 555-573 (2002).

        This is an improved CCSA (“conservative convex separable approximation”)
        variant of the original MMA algorithm published by Svanberg in 1987,
        which has become popular for topology optimization. (*Note:* “globally
        convergent” does *not* mean that this algorithm converges to the global
        optimum; it means that it is guaranteed to converge to *some* local
        minimum from any feasible starting point.)

        At each point **x**, MMA forms a local approximation using the gradient
        of *f* and the constraint functions, plus a quadratic “penalty” term to
        make the approximations “conservative” (upper bounds for the exact
        functions). The precise approximation MMA forms is difficult to describe
        in a few words, because it includes nonlinear terms consisting of a
        poles at some distance from *x* (outside of the current trust region),
        almost a kind of Padé approximant. The main point is that the
        approximation is both convex and separable, making it trivial to solve
        the approximate optimization by a dual method. Optimizing the
        approximation leads to a new candidate point **x**. The objective and
        constraints are evaluated at the candidate point. If the approximations
        were indeed conservative (upper bounds for the actual functions at the
        candidate point), then the process is restarted at the new **x**.
        Otherwise, the approximations are made more conservative (by increasing
        the penalty term) and re-optimized.

        objective function and constraints via a simplex of n+1 points (in n dimensions), and optimizes these
        approximations in a trust region at each step.

        This is a derivative of Powell's implementation of the COBYLA  algorithm for derivative-free optimization

        -  M. J. D. Powell, “Direct search algorithms for optimization
           calculations,” *Acta Numerica* **7**, 287-336 (1998).

        It constructs successive linear approximations of the objective function
        and constraints via a simplex of *n*\ +1 points (in *n* dimensions), and
        optimizes these approximations in a trust region at each step.

        The original code itself was written in Fortran by Powell and was
        converted to C in 2004 by Jean-Sebastien Roy (js@jeannot.org) for the
        SciPy project. The version in NLopt was based on Roy's C version and offers a few improvements
        over the original code:

        - `COBYLA` can increase the trust-region radius if the predicted improvement
          was approximately right and the simplex is OK
        - pseudo-randomization of the simplex steps in the COBYLA algorithm improve the robustness by avoiding
           accidentally taking steps that don't improve conditioning.

        “Multi-Level Single-Linkage” (MLSL) is an algorithm for global optimization by
        a sequence of local optimizations from random starting points, proposed
        by:

        -  A. H. G. Rinnooy Kan and G. T. Timmer, “Stochastic global
           optimization methods,” *Mathematical Programming*, vol. 39, p. 27-78
           (1987). (Actually 2 papers — part I: clustering methods, p. 27, then
           part II: multilevel methods, p. 57.)

        We also include a modification of MLSL use a Sobol' `low-discrepancy
        sequence`_ (LDS), also used in so-called
        `quasi Monte Carlo methods <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-Monte_Carlo_method>`_
        that can be invoked by setting *randomized* to False
        (as it is now *quasi*randomized) instead of pseudorandom numbers, which was argued to
        improve the convergence rate by:

        -  Sergei Kucherenko and Yury Sytsko, “Application of deterministic
           low-discrepancy sequences in global optimization,” *Computational
           Optimization and Applications*, vol. 30, p. 297-318 (2005).

        In either case, MLSL is a “multistart” algorithm: it works by doing a
        sequence of local optimizations (using some other local optimization
        algorithm) from random or low-discrepancy starting points. MLSL is
        distinguished, however by a “clustering” heuristic that helps it to
        avoid repeated searches of the same local optima, and has some
        theoretical guarantees of finding all local optima in a finite number of
        local minimizations.

        The local-search portion of MLSL can use any of the other algorithms in
        NLopt. The local search uses the
        derivative/nonderivative algorithm set by the *local_minimizer* argument.

               - a value of 0 means quiet and no output
               - above 0 up to 5, information that is good to know but without
                 flooding the user, corresponding to a "INFO" level.
               - A value above 5 starts printing out considerably more and
                 is used more for debugging purposes.
               - Setting the verbosity to 10 will print out every
                 evaluation of the loss function and gradient.

        """Improved Stochastic Ranking Evolution Strategy using a mutation rule and differential variation.

         The evolution strategy is based on a combination of a mutation rule (with a log-normal step-size update and
         exponential smoothing) and differential variation (a Nelder-Mead-like update rule).
         The fitness ranking is simply via the objective function for problems without nonlinear constraints,
         but when nonlinear constraints are included the stochastic ranking proposed by Runarsson and Yao is employed.

         The NLopt implementation is based on the method described in:

         - Thomas Philip Runarsson and Xin Yao,
          `"Search biases in constrained evolutionary optimization <http://www3.hi.is/~tpr/papers/RuYa05.pdf>"`_,
          *IEEE Trans. on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Part C: Applications and Reviews*,
           vol. 35 (no. 2), pp. 233-243 (2005).

         It is a refinement of an earlier method described in:

         - Thomas P. Runarsson and Xin Yao,
           `"Stochastic ranking for constrained evolutionary optimization
           <http://www3.hi.is/~tpr/software/sres/Tec311r.pdf>"`_, *IEEE Trans. Evolutionary Computation*,
           vol. 4 (no. 3), pp. 284-294 (2000).

         The actual implementation is independent provided by S. G. Johnson (2009) based on the papers above.
         Runarsson also has his own Matlab implemention available from `his web page <http://www3.hi.is/~tpr>`_.
