"""This module controls the zfit logging.

The base logger for zfit is called `zfit`, and all loggers created by this module
have the form `zfit.XX`, where `XX` is their name.

By default, time, name of the logger and message with the default
colorlog color scheme are printed.

    """Get and configure logger.

    This logger has two handlers:
        - A stdout handler is always configured with `colorlog`.
        - A file handler is configured if `file_name` is given. Once it has been configure, it is not
        necessary to give it to modify its properties.

    Once the logger has been created, `get_logger` can be called again to modify its log levels,
    independently for the stream and file handlers.

    Note:
        If the logger name doesn't start with "zfit", it is automatically added.

    Note:
        Default logging level at first instantiation is WARNING.

    Arguments:
        name: Name of the logger.
        stdout_level: Logging level for the stream handler. Defaults to `logging.WARNING`.
        file_level: Logging level for the file handler. Defaults to `logging.WARNING`.
        file_name: File to log to. If not given, no file logging is performed.

    Return:
        `logging.Logger`: The requested logger.

    Raise:
        ValueError if `file_level` has been specified without having configured the output file.
