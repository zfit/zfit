        <https://github.com/zfit/zfit/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=other.md&title=>`_ Exact, one dimensional,
        (truncated) Kernel Density Estimation with a Gaussian Kernel.

        This implementation features an exact implementation as is preferably used for smaller (max. ~ a few thousand
        points) data sets. For larger data sets, methods such as :py:class:`~zfit.pdf.KDE1DimGrid`
        that bin the dataset may be more efficient
        Kernel Density Estimation is a non-parametric method to approximate the density of given points.

        .. math::

            f_h(x) =  \frac{1}{nh} \sum_{i=1}^n K\Big(\frac{x-x_i}{h}\Big)

        where the kernel in this case is a (truncated) Gaussian

        .. math::
            K = \exp \Big(\frac{(x - x_i)^2}{\sigma^2}\Big)


        The bandwidth of the kernel can be estimated in different ways. It can either be a global bandwidth,
        corresponding to a single value, or a local bandwidth, each corresponding to one data point.

        **Usage**

        The KDE can be instantiated by using a numpy-like data sample, preferably a `zfit.Data` object. This
        will be used as the mean of the kernels. The bandwidth can either be given as a parameter (with length
        1 for a global one or length equal to the data size) - a rather advanced concept for methods such as
        cross validation - or determined from the data automatically, either through a simple method like
        scott or silverman rule of thumbs or through an iterative, adaptive method.

        Examples
        --------

        .. code-block:: python

            # generate some example kernels
            size = 150
            data = np.random.normal(size=size, loc=2, scale=3)

            limits = (-15, 5)
            obs = zfit.Space("obs1", limits=limits)
            kde_silverman = zfit.pdf.GaussianKDE1DimV1(data=data, obs=obs, bandwidth='silverman')

            # for a better smoothing of the kernels, use an adaptive approach
            kde = zfit.pdf.GaussianKDE1DimV1(data=data, obs=obs, bandwidth='adaptive')


        Args:
            data: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.data| Data sample to approximate
             the density from. The points represent positions of the *kernel*,
             the :math:`x_i`. This is preferrably a ``ZfitData``, but can also
             be an array-like object.

             If the data has weights, they will be taken into account.
             This will change the count of the events, whereas
             weight :math:`w_i` of :math:`x_i` will scale the value of
             :math:`K_i( x_i)`, resulting in a factor of :math:`\frac{w_i}{\sum w_i} `.

             If no weights are given, each kernel will be scaled by the same
             constant :math:`\frac{1}{n_{data}}`. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.data|

            obs: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.obs| Observable space of the KDE.
             As with any other PDF, this will be used as the default *norm*, but
             does not define the domain of the PDF. Namely, this can be a smaller
             space than *data*, as long as the name of the observable match.
             Using a larger dataset is actually good practice avoiding
             bountary biases, see also :ref:`sec-boundary-bias-and-padding`. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.obs|
            bandwidth: Valid pre-defined options are {'silverman', 'scott', 'adaptive'}.
             |@doc:pdf.kde.init.bandwidth| Bandwidth of the kernel,
             often also denoted as :math:`h`. For a Gaussian kernel, this
             corresponds to *sigma*. This can be calculated using
             pre-defined options or by specifying a numerical value that is
             broadcastable to *data* -- a scalar or an array-like
             object with the same size as *data*.

             A scalar value is usually referred to as a global bandwidth while
             an array holds local bandwidths |@docend:pdf.kde.init.bandwidth|

            The bandwidth can also be a parameter, which should be used with caution. However,
            it allows to use it in cross-valitadion with a likelihood method.


            weights: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.weights| Weights of each event
             in *data*, can be None or Tensor-like with shape compatible
             with *data*. Instead of using this parameter, it is preferred
             to use a ``ZfitData`` as *data* that contains weights.
             This will change the count of the events, whereas
             weight :math:`w_i` of :math:`x_i` will scale the value of :math:`K_i( x_i)`,
             resulting in a factor of :math:`\frac{w_i}{\sum w_i} `.

             If no weights are given, each kernel will be scaled by the same
             constant :math:`\frac{1}{n_{data}}`. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.weights|
            truncate: If a truncated Gaussian kernel should be used with the limits given by the `obs` lower and
                upper limits. This can cause NaNs in case datapoints are outside the limits.
            extended: |@doc:pdf.init.extended| The overall yield of the PDF.
               If this is parameter-like, it will be used as the yield,
               the expected number of events, and the PDF will be extended.
               An extended PDF has additional functionality, such as the
               ``ext_*`` methods and the ``counts`` (for binned PDFs). |@docend:pdf.init.extended|
            norm: |@doc:pdf.init.norm| Normalization of the PDF.
               By default, this is the same as the default space of the PDF. |@docend:pdf.init.norm|

             weakness: the boundaries, as the outside has a zero density. This makes the KDE
             go down at the bountary as well, as the density approaches zero, no matter what the
             density inside the boundary was.

             There are two ways to circumvent this problem:

               - the best solution: providing a larger dataset than the default space the PDF is used in
               - mirroring the existing data at the boundaries, which is equivalent to a boundary condition
                 with a zero derivative. This is a padding technique and can improve the boundaries.
                 However, one important drawback of this method is to keep in mind that this will actually
                 alter the PDF *to look mirrored*. If the PDF is plotted in a larger range, this becomes
                 clear.

             Possible options are a number (default 0.1) that depicts the fraction of the overall space
             that defines the data mirrored on both sides. For example, for a space from 0 to 5, a value of
             0.3 means that all data in the region of 0 to 1.5 is taken, mirrored around 0 as well as
             all data from 3.5 to 5 and mirrored at 5. The new data will go from -1.5 to 6.5, so the
             KDE is also having a shape outside the desired range. Using it only for the range 0 to 5
             hides this.
             Using a dict, each side separately (or only a single one) can be mirrored, like ``{'lowermirror: 0.1}``
             or ``{'lowermirror: 0.2, 'uppermirror': 0.1}``.
             For more control, a callable that takes data and weights can also be used. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.padding|

            weights: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.weights| Weights of each event
             in *data*, can be None or Tensor-like with shape compatible
             with *data*. Instead of using this parameter, it is preferred
             to use a ``ZfitData`` as *data* that contains weights.
             This will change the count of the events, whereas
             weight :math:`w_i` of :math:`x_i` will scale the value of :math:`K_i( x_i)`,
             resulting in a factor of :math:`\frac{w_i}{\sum w_i} `.

             If no weights are given, each kernel will be scaled by the same
             constant :math:`\frac{1}{n_{data}}`. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.weights|
            extended: |@doc:pdf.init.extended| The overall yield of the PDF.
               If this is parameter-like, it will be used as the yield,
               the expected number of events, and the PDF will be extended.
               An extended PDF has additional functionality, such as the

        r"""Kernel Density Estimation is a non-parametric method to approximate the density of given points.

        For a more in-depth explanation, see also in the section about Kernel Density Estimation
        :ref:`sec-grid-kdes`

        .. math::
            f_h(x) =  \frac{1}{nh} \sum_{i=1}^n K\Big(\frac{x-x_i}{h}\Big)

        Args:
            data: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.data| Data sample to approximate
             the density from. The points represent positions of the *kernel*,
             the :math:`x_i`. This is preferrably a ``ZfitData``, but can also
             be an array-like object.

             If the data has weights, they will be taken into account.
             This will change the count of the events, whereas
             weight :math:`w_i` of :math:`x_i` will scale the value of
             :math:`K_i( x_i)`, resulting in a factor of :math:`\frac{w_i}{\sum w_i} `.

             If no weights are given, each kernel will be scaled by the same
             constant :math:`\frac{1}{n_{data}}`. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.data|

            bandwidth: Valid pre-defined options are {'silverman', 'scott',
             'adaptive_zfit', 'adaptive_geom'}.
             |@doc:pdf.kde.init.bandwidth| Bandwidth of the kernel,
             often also denoted as :math:`h`. For a Gaussian kernel, this
             corresponds to *sigma*. This can be calculated using
             pre-defined options or by specifying a numerical value that is
             broadcastable to *data* -- a scalar or an array-like
             object with the same size as *data*.

             A scalar value is usually referred to as a global bandwidth while
             an array holds local bandwidths |@docend:pdf.kde.init.bandwidth|
            kernel: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.kernel| The kernel is the heart
             of the Kernel Density Estimation, which consists of the sum of
             kernels around each sample point. Therefore, a kernel should represent
             the distribution probability of a single data point as close as
             possible.

             The most widespread kernel is a Gaussian, or Normal, distribution. Due
             to the law of large numbers, the sum of many (arbitrary) random variables
             -- this is the case for most real world observable as they are the result of
             multiple consecutive random effects -- results in a Gaussian distribution.
             However, there are many cases where this assumption is not per-se true. In
             this cases an alternative kernel may offer a better choice.

             Valid choices are callables that return a
             :py:class:`~tensorflow_probability.distribution.Distribution`, such as all distributions
             that belong to the loc-scale family. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.kernel|
            padding: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.padding| KDEs have a peculiar
             weakness: the boundaries, as the outside has a zero density. This makes the KDE
             go down at the bountary as well, as the density approaches zero, no matter what the
             density inside the boundary was.

             There are two ways to circumvent this problem:

               - the best solution: providing a larger dataset than the default space the PDF is used in
               - mirroring the existing data at the boundaries, which is equivalent to a boundary condition
                 with a zero derivative. This is a padding technique and can improve the boundaries.
                 However, one important drawback of this method is to keep in mind that this will actually
                 alter the PDF *to look mirrored*. If the PDF is plotted in a larger range, this becomes
                 clear.

             Possible options are a number (default 0.1) that depicts the fraction of the overall space
             that defines the data mirrored on both sides. For example, for a space from 0 to 5, a value of
             0.3 means that all data in the region of 0 to 1.5 is taken, mirrored around 0 as well as
             all data from 3.5 to 5 and mirrored at 5. The new data will go from -1.5 to 6.5, so the
             KDE is also having a shape outside the desired range. Using it only for the range 0 to 5
             hides this.
             Using a dict, each side separately (or only a single one) can be mirrored, like ``{'lowermirror: 0.1}``
             or ``{'lowermirror: 0.2, 'uppermirror': 0.1}``.
             For more control, a callable that takes data and weights can also be used. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.padding|
            num_grid_points: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.num_grid_points| Number of points in
             the binning grid.

             The data will be binned using the *binning_method* in *num_grid_points*
             and this histogram grid will then be used as kernel points. This has the
             advantage to have a constant computational complexity independent of the data
             size.

             A number from 32 on can already yield good results, while the default is set
             to 1024, creating a fine grid. Lowering the number increases the performance
             at the cost of accuracy. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.num_grid_points|
            binning_method: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.binning_method| Method to be used for
             binning the data. Options are 'linear', 'simple'.

             The data can be binned in the usual way ('simple'), but this is less precise
             for KDEs, where we are interested in the shape of the histogram and smoothing
             it. Therefore, a better suited method, 'linear', is available.

             In normal binnig, each event (or weight) falls into the bin within the bin edges,
             while the neighbouring bins get zero counts from this event.
             In linear binning, the event is split between two bins, proportional to its
             closeness to each bin.

             The 'linear' method provides superior performance, most notably in small (~32)
             grids. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.binning_method|
            obs: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.obs| Observable space of the KDE.
             As with any other PDF, this will be used as the default *norm*, but
             does not define the domain of the PDF. Namely, this can be a smaller
             space than *data*, as long as the name of the observable match.
             Using a larger dataset is actually good practice avoiding
             bountary biases, see also :ref:`sec-boundary-bias-and-padding`. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.obs|
            weights: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.weights| Weights of each event
             in *data*, can be None or Tensor-like with shape compatible
             with *data*. Instead of using this parameter, it is preferred
             to use a ``ZfitData`` as *data* that contains weights.
             This will change the count of the events, whereas
             weight :math:`w_i` of :math:`x_i` will scale the value of :math:`K_i( x_i)`,
             resulting in a factor of :math:`\frac{w_i}{\sum w_i} `.

             If no weights are given, each kernel will be scaled by the same
             constant :math:`\frac{1}{n_{data}}`. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.weights|
            extended: |@doc:pdf.init.extended| The overall yield of the PDF.
               If this is parameter-like, it will be used as the yield,
               the expected number of events, and the PDF will be extended.
               An extended PDF has additional functionality, such as the
               ``ext_*`` methods and the ``counts`` (for binned PDFs). |@docend:pdf.init.extended|
            norm: |@doc:pdf.init.norm| Normalization of the PDF.
               By default, this is the same as the default space of the PDF. |@docend:pdf.init.norm|
            extended: |@doc:model.init.extended| Whether the PDF is extended
                or not. If True, the PDF can be integrated over the full space
                and the integral will be 1. If False, the integral will be the
                number of events in the dataset. |@docend:model.init.extended|
            name: |@doc:pdf.init.name| Name of the PDF.

        For a more in-depth explanation, see also in the section about Kernel Density Estimation
        :ref:`sec-fft-kdes`

        .. math::
            f_h(x) =  \frac{1}{nh} \sum_{i=1}^n K\Big(\frac{x-x_i}{h}\Big)

        It is computed by using a convolution of the data with the kernels evaluated at fixed grid points and then
        interpolating between this points to get an estimate for x.

        Args:
            data: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.data| Data sample to approximate
             the density from. The points represent positions of the *kernel*,
             the :math:`x_i`. This is preferrably a ``ZfitData``, but can also
             be an array-like object.

             If the data has weights, they will be taken into account.
             This will change the count of the events, whereas
             weight :math:`w_i` of :math:`x_i` will scale the value of
             :math:`K_i( x_i)`, resulting in a factor of :math:`\frac{w_i}{\sum w_i} `.

             If no weights are given, each kernel will be scaled by the same
             constant :math:`\frac{1}{n_{data}}`. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.data|
            bandwidth: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.bandwidth| Bandwidth of the kernel,
             often also denoted as :math:`h`. For a Gaussian kernel, this
             corresponds to *sigma*. This can be calculated using
             pre-defined options or by specifying a numerical value that is
             broadcastable to *data* -- a scalar or an array-like
             object with the same size as *data*.

             A scalar value is usually referred to as a global bandwidth while
             an array holds local bandwidths |@docend:pdf.kde.init.bandwidth|
            kernel: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.kernel| The kernel is the heart
             of the Kernel Density Estimation, which consists of the sum of
             kernels around each sample point. Therefore, a kernel should represent
             the distribution probability of a single data point as close as
             possible.

             The most widespread kernel is a Gaussian, or Normal, distribution. Due
             to the law of large numbers, the sum of many (arbitrary) random variables
             -- this is the case for most real world observable as they are the result of
             multiple consecutive random effects -- results in a Gaussian distribution.
             However, there are many cases where this assumption is not per-se true. In
             this cases an alternative kernel may offer a better choice.

             Valid choices are callables that return a
             :py:class:`~tensorflow_probability.distribution.Distribution`, such as all distributions
             that belong to the loc-scale family. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.kernel|
            padding: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.padding| KDEs have a peculiar
             weakness: the boundaries, as the outside has a zero density. This makes the KDE
             go down at the bountary as well, as the density approaches zero, no matter what the
             density inside the boundary was.

             There are two ways to circumvent this problem:

               - the best solution: providing a larger dataset than the default space the PDF is used in
               - mirroring the existing data at the boundaries, which is equivalent to a boundary condition
                 with a zero derivative. This is a padding technique and can improve the boundaries.
                 However, one important drawback of this method is to keep in mind that this will actually
                 alter the PDF *to look mirrored*. If the PDF is plotted in a larger range, this becomes
                 clear.

             Possible options are a number (default 0.1) that depicts the fraction of the overall space
             that defines the data mirrored on both sides. For example, for a space from 0 to 5, a value of
             0.3 means that all data in the region of 0 to 1.5 is taken, mirrored around 0 as well as
             all data from 3.5 to 5 and mirrored at 5. The new data will go from -1.5 to 6.5, so the
             KDE is also having a shape outside the desired range. Using it only for the range 0 to 5
             hides this.
             Using a dict, each side separately (or only a single one) can be mirrored, like ``{'lowermirror: 0.1}``
             or ``{'lowermirror: 0.2, 'uppermirror': 0.1}``.
             For more control, a callable that takes data and weights can also be used. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.padding|
            num_grid_points: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.num_grid_points| Number of points in
             the binning grid.

             The data will be binned using the *binning_method* in *num_grid_points*
             and this histogram grid will then be used as kernel points. This has the
             advantage to have a constant computational complexity independent of the data
             size.

             A number from 32 on can already yield good results, while the default is set
             to 1024, creating a fine grid. Lowering the number increases the performance
             at the cost of accuracy. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.num_grid_points|
            binning_method: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.binning_method| Method to be used for
             binning the data. Options are 'linear', 'simple'.

             The data can be binned in the usual way ('simple'), but this is less precise
             for KDEs, where we are interested in the shape of the histogram and smoothing
             it. Therefore, a better suited method, 'linear', is available.

             In normal binnig, each event (or weight) falls into the bin within the bin edges,
             while the neighbouring bins get zero counts from this event.
             In linear binning, the event is split between two bins, proportional to its
             closeness to each bin.

             The 'linear' method provides superior performance, most notably in small (~32)
             grids. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.binning_method|
            support:
            fft_method:
            obs: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.obs| Observable space of the KDE.
             As with any other PDF, this will be used as the default *norm*, but
             does not define the domain of the PDF. Namely, this can be a smaller
             space than *data*, as long as the name of the observable match.
             Using a larger dataset is actually good practice avoiding
             bountary biases, see also :ref:`sec-boundary-bias-and-padding`. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.obs|
            weights: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.weights| Weights of each event
             in *data*, can be None or Tensor-like with shape compatible
             with *data*. Instead of using this parameter, it is preferred
             to use a ``ZfitData`` as *data* that contains weights.
             This will change the count of the events, whereas
             weight :math:`w_i` of :math:`x_i` will scale the value of :math:`K_i( x_i)`,
             resulting in a factor of :math:`\frac{w_i}{\sum w_i} `.

             If no weights are given, each kernel will be scaled by the same
             constant :math:`\frac{1}{n_{data}}`. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.weights|
            extended: |@doc:pdf.init.extended| The overall yield of the PDF.
               If this is parameter-like, it will be used as the yield,
               the expected number of events, and the PDF will be extended.
               An extended PDF has additional functionality, such as the
               ``ext_*`` methods and the ``counts`` (for binned PDFs). |@docend:pdf.init.extended|
            norm: |@doc:pdf.init.norm| Normalization of the PDF.
               By default, this is the same as the default space of the PDF. |@docend:pdf.init.norm|
            extended: |@doc:pdf.init.extended| The overall yield of the PDF.

             constant :math:`\frac{1}{n_{data}}`. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.data|
            padding: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.padding| KDEs have a peculiar
             weakness: the boundaries, as the outside has a zero density. This makes the KDE
             go down at the bountary as well, as the density approaches zero, no matter what the
             density inside the boundary was.

             There are two ways to circumvent this problem:

               - the best solution: providing a larger dataset than the default space the PDF is used in
               - mirroring the existing data at the boundaries, which is equivalent to a boundary condition
                 with a zero derivative. This is a padding technique and can improve the boundaries.
                 However, one important drawback of this method is to keep in mind that this will actually
                 alter the PDF *to look mirrored*. If the PDF is plotted in a larger range, this becomes
                 clear.

             Possible options are a number (default 0.1) that depicts the fraction of the overall space
             that defines the data mirrored on both sides. For example, for a space from 0 to 5, a value of
             0.3 means that all data in the region of 0 to 1.5 is taken, mirrored around 0 as well as
             all data from 3.5 to 5 and mirrored at 5. The new data will go from -1.5 to 6.5, so the
             KDE is also having a shape outside the desired range. Using it only for the range 0 to 5
             hides this.
             Using a dict, each side separately (or only a single one) can be mirrored, like ``{'lowermirror: 0.1}``
             or ``{'lowermirror: 0.2, 'uppermirror': 0.1}``.
             For more control, a callable that takes data and weights can also be used. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.padding|
            num_grid_points: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.num_grid_points| Number of points in
             the binning grid.

             The data will be binned using the *binning_method* in *num_grid_points*
             and this histogram grid will then be used as kernel points. This has the
             advantage to have a constant computational complexity independent of the data
             size.

             A number from 32 on can already yield good results, while the default is set
             to 1024, creating a fine grid. Lowering the number increases the performance
             at the cost of accuracy. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.num_grid_points|
            binning_method: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.binning_method| Method to be used for
             binning the data. Options are 'linear', 'simple'.

             The data can be binned in the usual way ('simple'), but this is less precise
             for KDEs, where we are interested in the shape of the histogram and smoothing
             it. Therefore, a better suited method, 'linear', is available.

             In normal binnig, each event (or weight) falls into the bin within the bin edges,
             while the neighbouring bins get zero counts from this event.
             In linear binning, the event is split between two bins, proportional to its
             closeness to each bin.

             The 'linear' method provides superior performance, most notably in small (~32)
             grids. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.binning_method|
            obs: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.obs| Observable space of the KDE.
             As with any other PDF, this will be used as the default *norm*, but
             does not define the domain of the PDF. Namely, this can be a smaller
             space than *data*, as long as the name of the observable match.
             Using a larger dataset is actually good practice avoiding
             bountary biases, see also :ref:`sec-boundary-bias-and-padding`. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.obs|
            weights: |@doc:pdf.kde.init.weights| Weights of each event
             in *data*, can be None or Tensor-like with shape compatible
             with *data*. Instead of using this parameter, it is preferred
             to use a ``ZfitData`` as *data* that contains weights.
             This will change the count of the events, whereas
             weight :math:`w_i` of :math:`x_i` will scale the value of :math:`K_i( x_i)`,
             resulting in a factor of :math:`\frac{w_i}{\sum w_i} `.

             If no weights are given, each kernel will be scaled by the same
             constant :math:`\frac{1}{n_{data}}`. |@docend:pdf.kde.init.weights|
            norm: |@doc:pdf.init.norm| Normalization of the PDF.
               By default, this is the same as the default space of the PDF. |@docend:pdf.init.norm|
            extended: |@doc:pdf.init.extended| The overall yield of the PDF.
               If this is parameter-like, it will be used as the yield,
               the expected number of events, and the PDF will be extended.
               An extended PDF has additional functionality, such as the
               ``ext_*`` methods and the ``counts`` (for binned PDFs). |@docend:pdf.init.extended|
            name: |@doc:pdf.init.name| Name of the PDF.
               Maybe has implications on the serialization and deserialization of the PDF.
               For a human-readable name, use the label. |@docend:pdf.init.name|
            label: |@doc:pdf.init.label| Human-readable name
               or label of
               the PDF for a better description, to be used with plots etc.
               Has no programmatical functional purpose as identification. |@docend:pdf.init.label|
