        r"""*EXPERIMENTAL* Numerical Convolution pdf of `func` convoluted with `kernel` using FFT.

        CURRENTLY ONLY 1 DIMENSIONAL!

        EXPERIMENTAL: Feedback is very welcome! Performance, which parameters to tune, which fail etc.

        TL;DR technical details:

          - FFT-like technique: discretization of function. Number of bins splits the kernel into `n` bins
            and uses the same binwidth for the func while extending it by the kernel space. Internally,
            `tf.nn.convolution` is used.
          - Then interpolation by either linear or spline function
          - The kernel is assumed to be "small enough" outside of it's `space` and points there won't be
            evaluated.

        The convolution of two (normalized) functions is defined as

        .. math::

            (f * g)(t) \triangleq\ \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(\tau) g(t - \tau) \, d\tau

        It defines the "smearing" of `func` by a `kernel`. This is when an element in `func` is
        randomly added to an element of `kernel`. While the sampling (the addition of elements) is rather
        simple to do computationally, the calculation of the convolutional PDF (if there is no analytic
        solution available) is not, as it requires:

            - an integral from -inf to inf
            - an integral *for every point of x that is requested*

        This can be solved with a few tricks. Instead of integrating to infinity, it is usually sufficient to
        integrate from a point where the function is "small enough".

        If the functions are arbitrary and with conditional dependencies,
        there is no way around an integral and another PDF has to be used. If the two functions are
        uncorrelated, a simplified version can be done by a discretization of the space (followed by a
        Fast Fourier Transfrom, after which the convolution becomes a simple multiplication) and a
        discrete convolution can be performed.

        An interpolation of the discrete convolution for the requested points `x` is performed afterwards.


        Args:
            func: PDF  with `pdf` method that takes x and returns the function value.
                Here x is a `Data` with the obs and limits of *limits*.
            kernel: PDF with `pdf` method that takes x acting as the kernel.
                Here x is a `Data` with the obs and limits of *limits*.
            n: Number of points *per dimension* to evaluate the kernel and pdf at.
                The higher the number of points, the more accurate the convolution at the cost
                of computing time. If `None`, a heuristic is used (default to 100 in 1 dimension).
            limits_func: Specify in which limits the `func` should
                be evaluated for the convolution:

                - If `None`, the limits from the `func` are used and extended by a
                 default value (relative 0.2).
                - If float: the fraction of the limit do be extended. 0 means no extension,
                  1 would extend the limits to each side by the same size resulting in
                  a tripled size (for 1 dimension).
                  As an example, the limits (1, 5) with a `limits_func` of 0.5 would result in
                  effective limits of (-1, 7), as 0.5 * (5 - 1) = 2 has been added to each side.
                - If a space with limits is used, this is taken as the range.

            limits_kernel: the limits of the kernel. Usually not needed to change and automatically
                taken from the kernel.
            interpolation: Specify the method that is used for interpolation. Available methods are:

                - 'linear': this is the default for any convolution > 1 dimensional. It is a
                  fast, linear interpolation between the evaluated points and approximates the
                  function reasonably well in case of high number of points and a smooth response.
                - 'spline' or `f'spline:{order}'`: a spline interpolation with polynomials. If
                  the order is not specified, a default is used. To specify the order, 'spline'
                  should be followed  an integer, separated by a colon as e.g. in 'spline:3'
                  to use a spline of order three.
                  This method is considerably more computationally expensive as it requires to solve
                  a system of equations. When using 1000+ points this can affect the runtime critical.
                  However, it provides better solution, a curve that is smooth even with less points
                  than for a linear interpolation.

            obs: |@doc:pdf.init.obs| Observables of the
               model. This will be used as the default space of the PDF and,
               if not given explicitly, as the normalization range.

               The default space is used for example in the sample method: if no
               sampling limits are given, the default space is used.

               The observables are not equal to the domain as it does not restrict or
               truncate the model outside this range. |@docend:pdf.init.obs|
               If not specified, automatically taken from `func`
            extended: |@doc:pdf.init.extended| The overall yield of the PDF.
               If this is parameter-like, it will be used as the yield,
               the expected number of events, and the PDF will be extended.
               An extended PDF has additional functionality, such as the
               ``ext_*`` methods and the ``counts`` (for binned PDFs). |@docend:pdf.init.extended|
            norm: |@doc:pdf.init.norm| Normalization of the PDF.
               By default, this is the same as the default space of the PDF. |@docend:pdf.init.norm|
            name: |@doc:pdf.init.name| Name of the PDF.
               Maybe has implications on the serialization and deserialization of the PDF.
               For a human-readable name, use the label. |@docend:pdf.init.name|
            label: |@doc:pdf.init.label| Human-readable name
               or label of
               the PDF for a better description, to be used with plots etc.
               Has no programmatical functional purpose as identification. |@docend:pdf.init.label|
