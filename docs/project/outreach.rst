Outreach
===============

The project zfit aims to establish a basis in terms of API and basic functionality for a (likelihood) fitting
ecosystem that is capable of dealing with the demands from High Energy Physics (HEP).

    abstract = {Statistical modeling is a key element in many scientific fields and especially in
    High-Energy Physics (HEP) analysis. The standard framework to perform this task in HEP is the
    C++ ROOT/RooFit toolkit; with Python bindings that are only loosely integrated into the
    scientific Python ecosystem. In this paper, zfit, a new alternative to RooFit written in pure Python,
    is presented. Most of all, zfit provides a well defined high-level API and workflow
    for advanced model building and fitting, together with an implementation on top of TensorFlow,
    allowing a transparent usage of CPUs and GPUs. It is designed to be extendable in a
    very simple fashion, allowing the usage of cutting-edge developments from
    the scientific Python ecosystem in a transparent way. The main features of zfit are introduced,
    and its extension to data analysis, especially in the context of HEP experiments, is discussed.}
