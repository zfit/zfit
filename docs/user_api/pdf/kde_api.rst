Kernel Density Estimations
#############################

KDEs (Kernel Density Estimations) provide a means of non-parametric density estimation. They are useful when the underlying distribution of data is unknown or complex, and a parametric model might not be appropriate.

An extensive introduction and explanation can be found in
